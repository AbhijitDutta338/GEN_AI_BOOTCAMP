## PromptOps: Using GenAI to Automate Incident Management Workflows

Traditional incident management is reactive, manual, and slow. But what if your infrastructure could triage itself?

In this project, I have tried showcase how we can build an AI-powered incident response system that analyzes system logs in real time, summarizes root causes, and suggests actionable next steps — dramatically reducing mean time to resolution.

Powered entirely by Google Cloud, this system leverages Vertex AI, Cloud Logging, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions to deliver smart, automated incident insights.

Let’s replace panic with prompts.
